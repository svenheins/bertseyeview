37890889,"Advances in molecular pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","Although the past two decades have produced exciting discoveries in the genetics and pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), progress in developing an effective therapy remains slow. This review summarizes the critical discoveries and outlines the advances in disease characterization, diagnosis, imaging, and biomarkers, along with the current status of approaches to ALS care and treatment. Additional knowledge of the factors driving disease progression and heterogeneity will hopefully soon transform the care for patients with ALS into an individualized, multi-prong approach able to prevent disease progression sufficiently to allow for a dignified life with limited disability.","Gene:203228;C9ORF72,Gene:23435;TDP-43,Gene:2521;FUS,Gene:6647;SOD1,Gene:6239;/DNA binding
